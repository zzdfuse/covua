# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE "pip install -r requirements.txt" on Google Colab!
# The standard requirements.txt will cause dependency conflicts with Colab's environment.
#
# For Google Colab installation, see COLAB_SETUP.md or use this command-by-command approach:
#
# Step 1: Install system dependencies
#   !apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq ffmpeg
#
# Step 2: Install Python packages (one by one to avoid conflicts)
#   !pip install -q customtkinter==5.1.3 opennsfw2==0.10.2 opencv-python-headless==4.10.0.84
#   !pip install -q onnx==1.16.1 insightface==0.7.3 albucore==0.0.16 psutil==5.9.6
#   !pip install -q ftfy regex pyvirtualcam gradio==5.9.1
#   !pip install -q onnxruntime-gpu==1.20.1
#
# DO NOT install torch/torchvision - Colab already has compatible versions!
#
# Known Issues on Colab:
# - NumPy version conflicts (Colab needs >=2.0, roop works better with 1.26.4)
# - CUDA version mismatch (Colab has 12.6, standard requirements use 12.4)
# - Torch version conflicts (Colab has 2.8.0, standard requirements install 2.5.1)
#
# If you must use a requirements file format, here are the Colab-compatible packages:

customtkinter==5.1.3
opennsfw2==0.10.2
opencv-python-headless==4.10.0.84
onnx==1.16.1
insightface==0.7.3
albucore==0.0.16
psutil==5.9.6
ftfy
regex
pyvirtualcam
gradio==5.9.1
onnxruntime-gpu==1.20.1

# Note: Intentionally NOT including:
# - torch (use Colab's pre-installed version)
# - torchvision (use Colab's pre-installed version)  
# - numpy (use Colab's pre-installed numpy>=2.0)
# - tqdm (use Colab's pre-installed version)
# - websockets (gradio needs 14.2, but google-adk wants >=15.0.1 - ignore this conflict)
